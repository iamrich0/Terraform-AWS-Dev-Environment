This Terraform project sets up a basic development environment on AWS, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), a public subnet, an internet gateway, and a security group. It also provisions an EC2 instance within the public subnet, configured with user data for initialization. The infrastructure is designed to be simple and secure, making it suitable for development or testing purposes.
